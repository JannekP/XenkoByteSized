XenkoByteSized
---------------
Intended as a sort of dumping ground for various small samples of using Xenko to do various things, like procedurally generate meshes.

Project is currently on **Xenko 3.1.0.1-beta02**.

## [XenkoByteSized.ProceduralMesh](XenkoByteSized/XenkoByteSized.Game/ProceduralMesh/TetrahedronMesh.cs)
A simple example of creating a mesh procedurally by supplying vertices, also calculates normals automatically. Can be observed in the scene that loads when you open the project aside from the source itself.
